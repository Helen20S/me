TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Plodding along at the moment, listening is fine for now.  Will commit to finishing asap.
Well, tried to work with exercises 1-4 for week 3.  I will need to go back and refresh on all the activities. 
290620 ran tests on exercise 4.  Not sure of exercise 2. I ran mini tests and ran the file but it says "You got it!"  I think I totally missed something.  Still looking but quick class will start at 4pm today.
Learnt: that keyboard shortcuts are a lot faster to use when implementing data. 
Notes: copy of what range does, do a while loop, exercise 1.  Returns a range object for 1st exercise. The rest of the exercises in exercise 1 is in simple format.
RANGE (10) FUNCTION GIVES YOU VALUES FROM 0, 9.  
TO DO A RANGE: range(0, 10). x = range(10). x.next(). x.next. for i in range(10). 
... TAB INWARDS THEN TYPE :  print(i); ...;
TO DISCOVER: list(range(10)); list(range(3, 10)); list(range(3, 15, 3)); JUMPING NUMBERS.
MAKE A LIST: []
THE ANSWER TO FIRST QUESTION: 
the_numbers = []
x = start
while x < stop:
    print(x)
    the_numbers.append(x)
    x = x + step

return the_numbers
THAT IS THE LOOP RANGER ANSWER.
LOOK AT VARIABLES, THE ARGUMENT CHECK. THE DEFAULT = NONE.
TO TEST: 
exit()
python ..\course\week3\tests.py

MOVE TEST TO RIGHT: HIGHLIGHT AND TAB
MOVE TEST TO LEFT: HIGHLIGHT AND SHIFT TAB

CHANGE NAME AND VARIABLE AT THE SAME TIME
SAVE DOCUMENT
F2     (ITS' SCOPE SENSITIVE)

ALT  MOVES LINES AND BLOCKS UP AND DOWN.

HIGHLIGHT WHOLE BLOCK AND USE CONTROL /  :  YOU CAN COMMENT OR UNCOMMENT WHOLE BLOCK.


CONTROL SHIFT P :  KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS  :  BEING FAST IN KEYBOARD SKILLS.


IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, YOU CAN PRESS  CONTROL + P, AND IT TELLS YOU WHERE YOU ARE AT.

WRAP:( 
range(10); list(range(10)); def old_range(end):;  AT THIS POINT, WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE COMPLEXITY DISAPPEAR.  ABSTRACTING WAY OF COMPLEXITY.

...    list(range(0, end, 1)); ...; old_range(7); def old_range(end)):;
    return list(range(0, end, 1));
    old+range(7).
RETURNS AS A LIST EXTRACTED BIBS AND BOBS. WRAP RANGE INSIDE IN FUNCTION IN WAY INSIDE AND GET BACK LIST.

STUBBORN_ASKER  : TYPE
input("give me some input")
hello
input("give me some input")
6
input("give me some input: ")
trees
MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. USING THAT INPUT MEANS THAT USER CAN INTERACT WITH THE PROGRAM, THAT YOUR WRITING.
NEED IT for GAMES
THINK LOGIC
THE NOT_NUMBERS OF REJECTOR; A TRY ACCEPT BLOCK USEFUL.  

Exercise 1 : Line 48 to 76 made changes.

save exercise, fixes formating issues.
Never use   Continuum Break  See Lecture 3 Video recording.  2:37
Keep it simple. Test string to see if it's a number.
Copying it testing in there.

Lecture 3: 2:50:00      LOOK AGAIN!!!
Red warning.    Doubt right thing that was saven money.

You need to store the original value    2:59:00.
ONLY NO (NOT AN INTEGER) IS FALSE IT'S A STRING FALSE = FALSE, TRUE STRING = 23.
Convert STR to integer if works in try you TRY ACCEPTING.  ON.
