TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Plodding along at the moment, listening is fine for now.  Will commit to finishing asap.
Well, tried to work with exercises 1-4 for week 3.  I will need to go back and refresh on all the activities. 
290620 ran tests on exercise 4.  Not sure of exercise 2. I ran mini tests and ran the file but it says "You got it!"  I think I totally missed something.  Still looking but quick class will start at 4pm today.
Learnt: that keyboard shortcuts are a lot faster to use when implementing data. 
Notes: copy of what range does, do a while loop, exercise 1.  Returns a range object for 1st excercise. The rest of the exercises in exercise 1 is in simple format.
RANGE (10) FUNCTION GIVES YOU VALUES FROM 0, 9.  
TO DO A RANGE: range(0, 10). x = range(10). x.next(). x.next. for i in range(10). 
... TAB INWARDS THEN TYPE :  print(i); ...;
TO DISCOVER: list(range(10)); list(range(3, 10)); list(range(3, 15, 3)); JUMPING NUMBERS.
MAKE A LIST: []
THE ANSWER TO FIRST QUESTION: 
the_numbers = []
x = start
while x < stop:
    print(x)
    the_numbers.append(x)
    x = x + step

return the_numbers
THAT IS THE LOOP RANGER ANSWER.
LOOK AT VARIABLES, THE ARGUMENT CHECK. THE DEFAULT = NONE.
TO TEST: 
exit()
python ..\course\week3\tests.py

MOVE TEST TO RIGHT: HIGHLIGHT AND TAB
MOVE TEST TO LEFT: HIGHLIGHT AND SHIFT TAB

CHANGE NAME AND VARIABLE AT THE SAME TIME
SAVE DOCUMENT
F2     (ITS' SCOPE SENSITIVE)

ALT  MOVES LINES AND BLOCKS UP AND DOWN.

HIGHLIGHT WHOLE BLOCK AND USE CONTROL /  :  YOU CAN COMMENT OR UNCOMMENT WHOLE BLOCK.


CONTROL SHIFT P :  KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS  :  BEING FAST IN KEYBOARD SKILLS.


IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, YOU CAN PRESS  CONTROL + P, AND IT TELLS YOU WHERE YOU ARE AT.
