TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Plodding along at the moment, listening is fine for now.  Will commit to finishing asap.
Well, tried to work with exercises 1-4 for week 3.  I will need to go back and refresh on all the activities. 
290620 ran tests on exercise 4.  Not sure of exercise 2. I ran mini tests and ran the file but it says "You got it!"  I think I totally missed something.  Still looking but quick class will start at 4pm today.
