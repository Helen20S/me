TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I am writing basics into Listings.csv for Airbnb.  I missed some lectures because of poor connection and found it difficult to stay on top of everything.  Especially Covid19 situations.  I need more time as all sorts of worry had embedded into my life.  It would have been so much easier if government body had actually paid Austudy and rented out in Sydney, as they promised!  I have waited 9 months, if I were pregnant again they may overturn their decision.  I did not know that this distraction would be a major problem for my studies.  Hope I get more help and in studies.  I am trying and then I sometimes want to give up.  I am like a train of hopelessness, trying to hope.  One minute it goes along and then it has a whole series of loaded railroad trucks and then it stops for sometime, and then again.  I need a positive injunction!  Argh!!!
Graphisation isn't clear.  I cannot get into the first lectures, cannot find them also.  I am looking in the wrong area.  
I need some iced vo-vo's and ice cream.  I don't want to starve my emotions, l want to celebrate them; a period of uncertainty. Then, I can move on.  I discovered that if its not a celebration at least once a week then everything goes awry.  I then have a better focused point.
